# Steps to to run the test

1. Using Jetbrains or any other Java IDE, open the backend folder and run the `BackendApplication` entry point class. 
2. Using a terminal, go to the `frontend` folder
3. Run: `npm install` 
4. Run `npm run dev`

In the terminal you'll see the url, most likely should be http://localhost:5173, unless the 5173 port is already in use in your computer which is highly unlikely.


On the page, you'll first see a table that contains 2 builds. I copy/pasted the json data to add more stuff and make it more fun. When you click on the "eye", it will open the test types. 
Again, click the eye and it will show the Chart.js graph alonside a table where you can modify using a CRUD the test results. The chart and the table will update on realtime.

Hope everything looks good.
